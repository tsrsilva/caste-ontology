2;Hymenoptera;Formicidae;Diacamma ceylonense;database;adult;https://www.antwiki.org/wiki/Diacamma_ceylonense;;"In Diacamma, the future gamergate is very aggressive towards infertile workers during the first days of her adult life. Overt aggression disappears at about three weeks in D. ceylonense, when the future gamergate begins to lay male-destined eggs and is ready to mate. Over the same period, her Cuticular Hydrocarbons profile alters, changing from a chemical signature similar to that of a sterile worker towards that of a gamergate (Cuvillier-Hot et al. 2002). In nature, these behavioural and chemical changes coincide with a reduction in conflict within the nest: faced with a virgin future gamergate, infertile workers have an interest in producing male-destined eggs; however, once the gamergate produces female eggs, they have an interest in rearing her offspring. This is a clear demonstration of a shift from physical inhibition to chemical signalling.";Antwiki;;

Thorax structure of winged and wingless males is much the same, hence it is not appropriate to describe the latter as ergatoid males, because their thorax is not reduced and worker-like (confirmed by SEM).

All colonies (from Ulu Gombak, Peninsular Malaysia) were monogynous with one mated egg-laying female. Colony size was very small with fewer than 10 workers.

8;Hymenoptera;Formicidae;Ophthalmopone berthoudi;database;adult;https://www.antwiki.org/wiki/Ophthalmopone_berthoudi;;"Twelve nests were excavated near Hoedspruit (Limpopo province) and a total of 619 workers were dissected. The number of mated workers per nest ranged from 1 to 36, and ovarian activity varied according to how many were present in a nest (Sledge et al. 1996). In nests with high proportions of mated workers, they exhibited diverse behaviours (mainly brood-related) and in some cases could not be distinguished behaviourally from virgin workers. In nests with low proportions of gamergates, these were more fecund and did not participate in colony labour. The behavioural profile of gamergates is therefore linked to their reproductive physiology (Sledge et al. 1999). Unlike other queenless ants where dominance interactions regulate reproductive activity among workers, there is no aggression in O. berthoudi, and mesh experiments showed that contact pheromones underlie regulation (Sledge et al. 2001).";Antwiki;;

Males enter foreign colonies and mate preferentially with the younger workers (Peeters & Crewe, 1986). There is apparently no social regulation over which or how many workers mate. Sledge et al. (2001) found no evidence of aggressive dominance interactions among gamergates or between gamergates and unmated workers in O. berthoudi, though they found clear evidence that gamergates chemically suppress haploid egg production in virgin workers. The fecundity of gamergates is low (fewer than one egg per gamergate per day; Peeters & Crewe, 1985a), which is offset by the presence of multiple reproductives per colony. Sledge et al. (1999) studied the division of labor in O. berthoudi colonies and found that as the percentage of gamergates in a colony decreases over a season, the fecundity of the gamergates increases and their range of activities becomes more restricted. Gamergates are never found outside the nest except during nest transfers (Peeters & Crewe, 1985a).";Antwiki;;

There is a single gamergate present in B. kruegeri colonies, which had 3 to 6 mature oocytes (Peeters and Crewe, 1985; Peeters and Crewe, 1986; Wildman and Crewe, 1988; and Peeters and Higashi, 1989). Moreover, B. kruegeri gamergates are able to produce between 0.5-3 eggs per day (Wildman and Crewe, 1988).

A dominance hierarchy exists in a colony, with high-ranking workers (mostly young) subordinate to the alpha but dominant over low-ranking individuals. Only alpha can mate with a foreign male, and she is then the gamergate. Behavioural observations of experimentally disturbed hierarchies were integrated with physiological measures of fertility (vitellogenin titre in the haemolymph) and chemical analysis of Cuticular Hydrocarbons, which are putative fertility pheromones. This multifaceted approach revealed that alpha differentiates through aggression among high-ranking workers, but once she is established, chemical signalling is enough to maintain its monopoly.";Antwiki;;

;;;Polistes metricus;literature;adult;;;"We identified 285 nourishment-responsive transcripts, many of which are related to lipid metabolism and oxidation-reduction activity. Via comparisons to previously identified caste-related genes, we found that nourishment restriction only partially biased wasp gene expression patterns toward worker caste-like traits, which supports the notion that nourishment, in conjunction with social environment, is a determinant of developmental caste bias.";;;
